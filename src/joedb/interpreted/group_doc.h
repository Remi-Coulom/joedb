/// interpreted database table storage

/// Unlike compiled databases, the schema of an interpreted database is
/// dynamic, and can change at run time. Interpreted databases are used in
/// generic command-line tools such as joedbi and joedbc. They do not support
/// unique indexes or other consistency constraints that compiled databases
/// support.
