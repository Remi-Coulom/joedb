Introduction
============

crazydb is a relational database that stores data in an append-only journal file. It is designed to be used as an embedded database. It comes with a compiler that takes a database schema as input and produces C++ code. This code can load the data from the journal file into transparently persistent C++ data structures.

This approach allows crazydb to have the following nice properties:

- The full data history is stored. It is possible to undo any data modification.
- There is no SQL string manipulation. This removes the possibility of SQL injection, and the performance cost of SQL interpretation.
- Tables of the relational schema are compiled into classes. This way, errors in tables names, field names or types can be detected at compile time, instead of run time.
- This approach offers great opportunities for performance optimization. Data is directly stored in C++ data structures. The programmer is free to choose which container best fits each table. So, for instance, a dense table can be kept in a simple C++ std::vector if it is small enough to fit in memory. Huge tables can be stored on disk with `stxxl <http://stxxl.sourceforge.net/>`_ containers. Indexes and triggers are implemented in C++, too. So, in short, the programmer of the application controls the data-management code completely, and can make it as efficient as possible.

The drawbacks of this approach, compared to more traditional database management systems are:

- It is necessary to read the whole data history when opening a crazydb file. This may be slow for large amounts of data.
- The crazydb file may become very big compared to the size of the data for a database that has a lot of updates and deletes.

In many situations, these drawbacks are not a problem. For a server application that is rarely restarted, a slow startup time is not so annoying.  And if it is really a problem to keep the whole history (for space or privacy reasons), then the journal file can be compacted to keep only the most recent state.

The application can manipulate the data this way

.. code-block:: c++

    #include "tutorial.h"

    int main()
    {
      tutorial::database db("tutorial.crazydb");

      tutorial::city Lille = db.insert_city();
      db.update_name(Lille, "Lille");

      tutorial::person remi = db.insert_person("RÃ©mi", tutorial::city::null);

      db.update_city(remi, Lille);

      db.delete_person(remi);

      db.begin_transaction();
      db.end_transaction();

      return 0;
    }
