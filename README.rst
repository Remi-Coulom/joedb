joedb, the Journal-Only Embedded Database
=========================================

The aim of joedb is to offer a simple embedded relational database, where data is manipulated directly in the target programming language, without using SQL. Only C++ is supported currently, but other languages could be added in the future.

Joedb is currently a proof-of-concept prototype. It was released with the aim to get feedback and reviews. It is not yet ready for real-world use, but the most basic features work, and you are welcome to try them.

To get started, please take at a look at the _`Documentation http://remi.coulom.free.fr/joedb/`. It contains a detailed introduction, and a short tutorial that demonstrates how to use joedb.
